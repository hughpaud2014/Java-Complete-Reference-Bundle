## Explanation of this example

Floating-point types represent numbers with fractional parts. Java has two such types: double (64 bits) and float (32 bits). These types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits (~6-7 for float and ~14-16 for double). Usually, you will use the double type in practice.

<em>double 8 bytes Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits</em>

<em> Note: The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the file name. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to W3 schools [how to get started](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_getstarted.asp) for instructions to install Java.</em>
