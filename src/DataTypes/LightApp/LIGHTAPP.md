## Explanation of this example

Java defines what is called primitive data types. In computer science, a primitive is a fundamental data type that cannot be broken down into a more simple data type. In this example we show the usage of the <em>long</em> data type to compute the distance of light travels.

Long is a signed 64-bit data type and is useful on occasions where an integer type is not large enogh to hold the desired value. The range of a long is quite large.

`long: size 64 bits (8 bytes), range from −(263) to (263)−1`
