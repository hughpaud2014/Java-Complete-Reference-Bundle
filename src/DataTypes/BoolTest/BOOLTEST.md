## Explanation of this example

<p>Java has a primitive type, called boolean, for logical values. One of the most often used computing a program will involve condition based decision making, that is where booleans come in.</p>

<p>A perfect example is a application that needs to accept user inout to verify login credentials.</p>

<code>
// Psuedo code

registeredUser = true;
return grantAccess();

registeredUser = false;
return registerUser();

</code>
