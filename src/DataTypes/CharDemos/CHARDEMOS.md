## Explanation of this example

### Characters

<p>Java has a type named char to represent letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols. Each character is just a single letter enclosed in single quotes. This type has the same size as the short type (2 bytes = 16 bit).</p>

<code>

1. char lowerCaseLetter = ‘a’;
2. char upperCaseLetter = ‘Q’;
3. char dollar = ‘$’;

</code>

 <p>Characters represent symbols from many alphabets including hieroglyphs, as well as some special symbols which will be studied in the following lessons.</p>
