## Explanation of this example
<p>As we seen, so far, all variabkles used have been declared at the start of the main() method. Now, Java allows variables to be declared within any block.</p>

<p>A block defines a scope. Thus, each time you start a new block, you are creating a new scope. A scope determines what objects are visible to other parts of your program. It also determines the lifetime of those objects.</p>
