## Explanation of this example

Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathmatics. See references in the <em>Recommended Links section</em> of this document.
The conditional statement is a structure that allows the app/program to execute various functions based on a met criteria. Think of this as a simple human thought and step away for a second from code in this following example:

<em>If hungry, then eat food</em>

I am sure in your quest to be a coding 'god' you thought the human example would be complex, in some cases it can but I wil not dive into it and turn this into human studies. So in the `IfSample.java` we explore a simple "If" conditional statement to computate the 'x' and 'y' variables with certain criterias to generate a result.

### Note: Simple rule of thumb to remember the syntax of an 'If' statement it is : <em>if(condition)statement</em>

### Note: The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the file name. To run the example above on your computer,

### make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to W3 schools [how to get started](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_getstarted.asp) for how to install Java.
