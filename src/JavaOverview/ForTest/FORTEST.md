## Explanation of this example

In Java and every other programming language a <em>for loop</em> is used to execute through a specific block of code till a certain criteria is met.
Back to our human life process examples here is another one:

<em>There is 0 dirty dishes, while the dishes is less than 5, add a dirty dish.</em>

In this example it is slightly more complex, especially to us that don't like to wash dishes, but really and truly it not an attempt to code an 'AI' algorithim. In the `ForTest.java' you can see that we assign a value to 'x', while 'x' < 10 we increment 'x' by 1

<em>Note:</em> Rule of thumb for syntax of a 'for loop' is: <em>for(initialization; condition; iteration)statement;</em>

<em> Note: The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the file name. To run the example above on your computer,
